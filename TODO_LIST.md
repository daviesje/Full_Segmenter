# TO DO LIST FOR SEGMENTER

- remove all absolute paths

- get rid of all hardcoded parameters

- write docstrings for all the files

- make into an installed package

- write some unit tests

- include argparse in train_model and predict

- upload a more recent model (github has trouble fitting the large ones)
